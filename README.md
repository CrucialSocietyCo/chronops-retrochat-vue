# Society on South Main — RetroChat Frontend (ChronOps)

This repository contains the public-facing frontend for Society on South Main, a real-time chat web application built with a retro-inspired interface and modern UX engineering practices.

The frontend is part of the broader ChronOps system:

- **RetroChat Frontend (this repo)**: the user-facing chat experience
- **ChronOps Admin OS**: moderation and administrative tooling that supports governance and operational control
- **Live site**: [https://southmain.app](https://southmain.app)

## What This Is

Society on South Main is designed to deliver a fast, readable, and intuitive chat experience. This frontend focuses on:

- Clear message flow and conversation readability
- Responsive interaction patterns for web and mobile
- Component-based UI architecture that scales as features grow
- UX decisions that support community use at real-world pace

## Key UX & Frontend Features

### Real-Time Chat Experience
UI optimized for message clarity, input ergonomics, and predictable interaction patterns.

### Retro-Inspired UI System
A distinct visual style implemented without sacrificing usability, layout consistency, or performance.

### Component-Based Architecture
Reusable UI patterns designed to support maintainability and rapid iteration.

### Responsive Interface Design
Layout and interaction behavior designed to work cleanly across screen sizes and devices.

## AI-Assisted Development Approach (Human-Led)

This frontend was developed using AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate implementation and iteration.

AI tools were used to:

- Speed up repetitive UI implementation tasks
- Assist with refactoring and debugging
- Explore alternate component and layout approaches

All UX decisions—including layout hierarchy, interaction patterns, and usability tradeoffs—were human-directed. AI output was reviewed and shaped to ensure alignment with:

- UX intent and product goals
- Accessibility and usability expectations
- Maintainable code structure

This project emphasizes human-in-the-loop collaboration, where AI increases velocity but does not replace judgment.

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js (frontend framework)
- Component-based UI patterns
- Real-time UI interaction model

*Note: Implementation details may evolve as the platform continues to develop.*
